# My Dotfiles Repository

> [!CAUTION]
> This is still WIP and should be used with care in production!

This is a collection of my personal dotfiles.

## Motivation

I'm sharing these files publicly to help myself (and others) keep track of their system configurations across multiple machines. By storing them in a Git repository, I can easily version control my settings and ensure they're consistent across all my devices.

## Contents

This repository includes the following dotfiles:

- ~/.bashrc and ~/.zshrc: My shell configuration files.
- ~/.vimrc: My Vim editor configuration file.
And more...


## How to use

1. Clone the repository and cd into it.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-dotfiles.git
cd my-dotfiles
```

2. Run installer script `installer.sh`


## Contributing

Feel free to fork and contribute to this repository if you'd like to add or improve any of the included files.
